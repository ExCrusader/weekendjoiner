# TPI & PPI

I am always forgetting how a handsaw's TPI (teeth per inch) and PPI (points per inch) relate to each other. It really couldn't be simpler.

**PPI = TPI + 1**

Now it should be much simpler to figure out which size saw file to use when my source for saw files (Grobet Swiss at Lee Valley) uses TPI, but most everyone else use PPI.
