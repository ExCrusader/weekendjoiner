> There are five cures for tearing:

> 1. Reverse the direction of planing.
> 2. Sharpen the blade.
> 3. Take a very fine cut.
> 4. Set the cap iron very close.
> 5. Close up the mouth.

> Anyone of these or a combination of any number of them will prevent tearing. On the other hand, too close a cap iron and too fine a mouth will cause "clogging." It is always worth examining the mouth as this may be poorly formed or obstructed by a blob of paint, which can be removed by gentle filing.
